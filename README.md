# PINN-and-JAX

Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a powerful tool for computation of solutions for Partial Diferential Equations. 

This project also contains a brief intoduction to JAX, oriented to the PINN construction. JAX is a python library developed by google for accelerator-oriented array computation, used, among other things, to get a better performance in large-scale machine learning programs.

## Installation

The code is on the anaconda distribution. All packages were installed through conda package manager.

## Contributing

Code is still being updating, since the main goal is to have a more comprehensive introduction to PINN's and JAX. Comments are welcome.
